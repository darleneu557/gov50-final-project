## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to whether there is an increase in incarceration around presidential election times and then compare this to typically blue and red states. I also would be interested in exploring data related to how new voters and voters who turned out in one or both previous elections voted in the 2020 presidential election with a detailed portrait of the demographic composition and vote choices of the 2020 electorate.
